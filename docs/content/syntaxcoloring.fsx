Syntax coloring
-----------------------

We currently support coloring:

- types
- value types
- modules
- functions / methods (off by default)
- quotations
- patterns (off by default)
- mutable variables / reference cells (off by default)
- unused non public types, methods, functions and values declarations
- unused open statements

There is a special user setting for enabling graying out unused declarations and open statements.

[Unused declaration markers](#marker)
-----------------------

If unused declarations and open statements are found in current file, orange markers will appear on top of vertical scroll bar.
You can navigate to lines consisting of unused items by clicking on these markers (see the screenshot below).
