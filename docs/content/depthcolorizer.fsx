Depth colorizer
----------------

This feature, originally written by Brian McNamara, highlights the indentation in code using color.

For instance this code with the colorizer turned on

![Not colorized](img/notcolorized.png)

would look like this

![Colorized](img/colorized.png)

The default scheme used in Visual F# Power Tools only uses a grey border to indicate indentation in F# source code.
If you prefer original colorful themes, custom colors can be added to the registry as documented [here](http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/f-source-code-structural-colorizer-available/).

Here are two popular schemes for light theme: [Grey Scale](img/FSDCLightGrey.reg) and [Red Blue](img/FSDCLightRedBlue.reg) 
and two other schemes for dark theme: [Default](img/FSDCDarkDefault.reg) and [Custom](img/FSDCDarkCustom.reg).
