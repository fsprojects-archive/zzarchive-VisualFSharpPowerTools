Depth colorizer
----------------

This feature, originally written by Brian McNamara, highlights the indentation in code using color.

It looks like this in the light Visual Studio theme

And in the dark theme

The default scheme used in Visual F# Power Tools only uses a grey border to indicate indentation in F# source code (as on the 
examples above).
If you prefer original colorful themes, custom colors can be added to the registry as documented [here](http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/f-source-code-structural-colorizer-available/).

Here are two popular schemes for light theme: [Grey Scale](img/FSDCLightGrey.reg) and [Red Blue](img/FSDCLightRedBlue.reg) 
and two other schemes for dark theme: [Default](img/FSDCDarkDefault.reg) and [Custom](img/FSDCDarkCustom.reg).
