Visual F# Power Tools
=====================

Power commands for F# in Visual Studio

### Why Visual F# Power Tools?
Visual F# Power Tools is a community effort to bring useful F# VS extensions into a single home for the following purposes:
 - Easy maintenance and upgrade
 - Sharing common functionalities and reducing conflicts between F# VS extensions
 - Adding new features which complement Visual F# Tools for VS

This project is made possible by excellent work in [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service)
and [FSharpBinding](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding).

### Currently supported features
 - Auto-generating XmlDoc (via [F# XmlDoc extension](http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/source-code-for-f-xmldoc-extension/))
 - Formatting document / Formatting selection (via [Fantomas extension](https://github.com/dungpa/fantomas))
 - Navigation bar (see [this article](http://tomasp.net/blog/regions-navigation.aspx/))
 - Highlight references
 - Rename refactoring
 - Depth colorizer
 - NavigateTo
